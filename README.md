**Project Title: Task Management Application**

**Project Description:**

A task management application using Angular. This project will allow users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. It's a practical project that demonstrates my understanding of Angular's core concepts like components, services, routing, and forms.

**Key Features:**

1. **Task List:** Display a list of tasks with their titles, descriptions, due dates, and statuses (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

2. **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks to the list. Include a form with fields for the task title, description, due date, and status.

3. **Edit Task:** Users can edit existing tasks. Implement a feature that allows them to update task details.

4. **Delete Task:** Provide an option to delete tasks from the list.

5. **Task Filtering:** Implement filters to view tasks by status (e.g., "All," "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

6. **Task Details:** Create a detailed view for each task, showing all information about the task.

7. **Validation:** Add form validation to ensure that required fields are filled out correctly.

8. **Routing:** Use Angular's routing to navigate between task list, task details, and the task editing form.

**Technologies and Tools:**

- Angular
- Angular CLI for project setup
- TypeScript for coding
- HTML and CSS for the user interface
- Angular Forms for input validation
- Angular Router for navigation
- JSON data or a simple API (you can use mock data if you don't want to build a backend)

**Bonus Features (Optional):**

- User authentication and user-specific task lists (for more advanced users)
- Task priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low)
- Task search functionality
- Responsive design for mobile devices
